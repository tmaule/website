            "content": "Abstract . On September 17, 2019, Yu Darvish recorded eight consecutive strikeouts for the Chicago Cubs. It was clear that this was regarded by the broadcast crew as tremendously rare, and much historical context was given &mdash; including reference to the MLB record of ten consecutive strikeouts by Tom Seaver in 1970. Given that one of the most significant changes in baseball over the past several decades is the increase in strikeout rate, I was curious to find out how much more likely such an occurrence is today versus 50 years ago. . In the end, what I find is that we&#39;re living in a time where the frequency of such events is increasing exponentially, and so looking back is bound to deceive. Finally, I show that the empirical data does fit this model fairly well, and if current trends continue this effect is about to become much more noticeable. . . Getting started . In order to find the expected rate of incidence, we first need to establish: . How many opportunities are there? I.e. for potential streak length X, a given pitcher in each game has [total batters faced - X] opportunities to begin such a streak . | How likely is this streak to materialize? If our pitcher on average strikes out 25% of all batters he faces, the odds of striking out any string of eight batters in consecutive fashion is 0.25^8, or about 1 in 66,000. . | To that end, it was easy enough to get FanGraphs to spit out a table of all the usual pitching stats, SP only, MLB-wide, by year since 1900. . This does not include Batters Faced, but we can back that out using BF = 3*IP + H + BB + HBP. From there, we just need to back out the &#39;K rate&#39; using K / BF. . import pandas as pd %matplotlib inline pd.options.display.float_format = &#39;{:.2f}&#39;.format raw_stats = &#39;C:/Users/tmaul/Documents/GitHub/website/assets/raw_data/fan_graphs_sp_data.csv&#39; cols_to_use = [&#39;Season&#39;, &#39;GS&#39;, &#39;IP&#39;, &#39;H&#39;, &#39;BB&#39;, &#39;HBP&#39;, &#39;SO&#39;] # drop 2020 due to shortened season sp_data_fg = pd.read_csv(raw_stats, usecols=cols_to_use, index_col=&#39;Season&#39;).rename(columns={&#39;SO&#39; : &#39;K&#39;}).drop(2020) sp_data_fg[&#39;BF_est&#39;] = sp_data_fg.IP*3 + sp_data_fg.H + sp_data_fg.BB + sp_data_fg.HBP sp_data_fg[&#39;BF_per_start_est&#39;] = sp_data_fg.BF_est/sp_data_fg.GS sp_data_fg[&#39;K_rt_SP&#39;] = sp_data_fg.K/sp_data_fg.BF_est sp_data_fg # this is a limited approximation bc of RPs . .

A pastime unlike the past . Now that we have all of the necessary numbers in place, let&#39;s take a look at some basic trends. As expected, the &#39;K rate&#39; has increased dramatically in the last 100 years. However, we can also see that the average starting pitcher in 1900 faced almost twice as many batters as today, and this diminished opportunity will counteract the surge in punch-outs to some extent. . import matplotlib as plt # plt.rcdefaults() plt.style.use(&#39;seaborn&#39;) ax = sp_data_fg.plot(y=&#39;K_rt_SP&#39;, legend=None, color=&#39;tab:blue&#39;); ax.set_ylabel(&#39;K_rt_SP&#39;, fontsize=16, color=&#39;tab:blue&#39;); ax2 = ax.twinx(); sp_data_fg.plot(y=&#39;BF_per_start_est&#39;, ax=ax2, legend=None, color=&#39;tab:purple&#39;); ax2.set_ylabel(&#39;BF_per_start&#39;, fontsize=16, color=&#39;tab:purple&#39;); ax.grid(b=False, axis=&#39;y&#39;); ax2.grid(b=False, axis=&#39;y&#39;); . . &lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd&quot;&gt; 2021-01-26T16:59:01.326690 image/svg+xml Matplotlib v3.3.2, https://matplotlib.org/ Results and discussion . All that&#39;s left to do now is calculate the theoretical rate of incidence (shown below for X = 5, 8). A few interesting results: . With the rise of the strikeout, the expected number of K streaks is growing exponentially, in particular since 2000. . | We can see that the Darvish Effect is inevitable: something that has only happened a handful of times in MLB history sounds like a generational anomaly, and yet we can show that in today&#39;s game it will be orders of magnitude more common. . | In numerical terms: 50 years ago, we would expect a pitcher to record eight consecutive strikeouts just once in 57 MLB seasons. As of 2019, we can now expect once in 2.5 seasons. . | Drawing a direct comparison between Seaver&#39;s MLB record and Darvish&#39;s eight, we see that the former is almost 1200x less likely in expectation. . | . sp_data_fg[&#39;E_K5&#39;] = sp_data_fg.GS*(sp_data_fg.BF_per_start_est-4)*sp_data_fg.K_rt_SP**5 sp_data_fg[&#39;E_K8&#39;] = sp_data_fg.GS*(sp_data_fg.BF_per_start_est-7)*sp_data_fg.K_rt_SP**8 sp_data_fg[&#39;E_K10&#39;] = sp_data_fg.GS*(sp_data_fg.BF_per_start_est-9)*sp_data_fg.K_rt_SP**10 ax = sp_data_fg.plot(y=&#39;E_K5&#39;, legend=None, color=&#39;tab:blue&#39;); ax.set_ylabel(&#39;E_K5&#39;, color=&#39;tab:blue&#39;, fontsize=16); ax2 = ax.twinx(); sp_data_fg.plot(y=&#39;E_K8&#39;, ax=ax2, color=&#39;tab:purple&#39;, legend=None); ax2.set_ylabel(&#39;E_K8&#39;, color=&#39;tab:purple&#39;, fontsize=16); ax.grid(b=False, axis=&#39;y&#39;); ax2.grid(b=False, axis=&#39;y&#39;); ax.set_title(&#39;Expected Occurences of K Streak of Given Length Per MLB Season&#39;); . . &lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd&quot;&gt; 2021-01-26T16:59:01.863316 image/svg+xml Matplotlib v3.3.2, https://matplotlib.org/ seaver = sp_data_fg.E_K10[1970] darvish = sp_data_fg.E_K8[2019] K8_1970 = sp_data_fg.E_K8[1970] print(f&#39;1970: Expected one K8 streak every {round(1/K8_1970, 1)} seasons.&#39;) print(f&#39;2019: Expected one K8 streak every {round(1/darvish, 1)} seasons.&#39;) print(f&#39;Seaver &#39;s K10: about {int(darvish/seaver)} times less likely than Darvish &#39;s K8&#39;) . . 1970: Expected one K8 streak every 57.2 seasons. 2019: Expected one K8 streak every 2.5 seasons.

This analysis only uses MLB-wide &#39;K rate&#39; as an input &mdash; this is a major simplification. In reality, there will be above and below-average pitchers, and since the &#39;K rate&#39; is compounded, this should result in more observed streaks than our estimates. Furthermore, pitchers who are better than average and/or already having a great outing are more likely to remain in the game, and face more batters. . a. In the following section, we confirm this hypothesis using actual play-by-play logs . | As mentioned earlier, our source data only covers Starting Pitchers. This is fairly reasonable, as our chief concern was starters to begin with and, especially for streaks on the longer end, relievers are likely not much of a factor anyway. . | Using game logs from RetroSheet (or other data?), it should be theoretically possible to produce the exact number of observed K streaks per season. . | We could attempt a less stylized, more rigorous analysis by building some approximate underlying distributions for &#39;K rate&#39; among pitcher population and expected number and length of outings for each respective pitcher, then simulating outcomes. . | Appendix: Empirical results using Retrosheet . The best way (that I know of) to produce empirical streak data is by scraping the event logs maintained by Retrosheet. Although Retrosheet has logged every Major League game since 1871, reading every one of them is no small task. Here, we will start by unpacking one team, one season, before trying to scale up. . To start, let&#39;s parse the play-by-play file for the 2019 Chicago Cubs. We&#39;ll flag the start of each new game, as well as any notable streaks: . events = &#39;C:/Users/tmaul/Documents/GitHub/website/assets/raw_data/2019CHN.EVN&#39; ########|Parse generic event file|######## col_names = [&#39;type&#39;, &#39;f1&#39;, &#39;f2&#39;, &#39;f3&#39;, &#39;f4&#39;, &#39;f5&#39;, &#39;f6&#39;] df = pd.read_table(events, sep=&#39;,&#39;, names=col_names) #there are eleven possible event types, each of whitch contains at most 6 columns of info, we label these f1-f6 #detailed description of all event types and associated field can be found at retrosheet.org #this season (2019 Cubs home games) contains 13,859 events plays_to_ignore = [&#39;NP&#39;, &#39;CS&#39;, &#39;BK&#39;, &#39;PB&#39;, &#39;WP&#39;, &#39;PO&#39;, &#39;SB&#39;] k_streak_threshold = 5 # variable for index, row in df.iterrows(): if row[&#39;type&#39;] == &#39;id&#39;: game_id = row[&#39;f1&#39;] elif row[&#39;type&#39;] == &#39;info&#39;: if row[&#39;f1&#39;] == &#39;hometeam&#39;: h_team = row[&#39;f2&#39;] elif row[&#39;f1&#39;] == &#39;visteam&#39;: a_team = row[&#39;f2&#39;] elif row[&#39;f1&#39;] == &#39;date&#39;: game_date = pd.to_datetime(row[&#39;f2&#39;]).date() print(f&#39;{game_date}: {a_team} @ {h_team}&#39;) elif row[&#39;type&#39;] == &#39;start&#39; and row[&#39;f5&#39;] == &#39;1&#39;: # only care if SP declared if row[&#39;f3&#39;] == &#39;0&#39;: a_pitch = row[&#39;f1&#39;] a_streak = {a_pitch : 0} else: h_pitch = row[&#39;f1&#39;] h_streak = {h_pitch : 0} elif row[&#39;type&#39;] == &#39;play&#39;: if row[&#39;f2&#39;] == &#39;0&#39;: # 0 means away *batter* means home pitcher p = h_pitch else: p = a_pitch if row[&#39;f6&#39;][0] == &#39;K&#39;: # identify a strikeout (there *can* be modifiers after K so take 0th) if p in h_streak: h_streak[p] += 1 if h_streak[p] &gt;= k_streak_threshold: print(&#39;***K_STREAK_LENGTH &#39;, h_streak[p], &#39; BY &#39;, p, &#39;PITCHING FOR &#39;, h_team, &#39; ***&#39;) elif p in a_streak: a_streak[p] += 1 if a_streak[p] &gt;= k_streak_threshold: print(&#39;***K_STREAK_LENGTH &#39;, a_streak[p], &#39; BY &#39;, p, &#39;PITCHING FOR &#39;, a_team, &#39; ***&#39;) elif row[&#39;f6&#39;][0:2] in plays_to_ignore: # these &#39;play&#39; events do not constitute a plate app, ignore continue else: # zero out the streak if a real non-K play if p in h_streak: h_streak[p] = 0 elif p in a_streak: a_streak[p] = 0 elif row[&#39;type&#39;] == &#39;sub&#39; and row[&#39;f5&#39;] == &#39;1&#39;: if row[&#39;f3&#39;] == &#39;0&#39;: a_pitch = row[&#39;f1&#39;] a_streak = {a_pitch : 0} else: h_pitch = row[&#39;f1&#39;] h_streak = {h_pitch : 0} . . 2019-04-08: PIT @ CHN 2019-04-10: PIT @ CHN 2019-04-11: PIT @ CHN 2019-04-12: ANA @ CHN 2019-04-13: ANA @ CHN 2019-04-19: ARI @ CHN 2019-04-20: ARI @ CHN 2019-04-21: ARI @ CHN 2019-04-23: LAN @ CHN 2019-04-24: LAN @ CHN 2019-04-25: LAN @ CHN 2019-05-03: SLN @ CHN 2019-05-04: SLN @ CHN 2019-05-05: SLN @ CHN 2019-05-06: MIA @ CHN 2019-05-07: MIA @ CHN ***K_STREAK_LENGTH 5 BY smitc006 PITCHING FOR MIA *** 2019-05-08: MIA @ CHN 2019-05-09: MIA @ CHN 2019-05-10: MIL @ CHN 2019-05-11: MIL @ CHN 2019-05-12: MIL @ CHN 2019-05-20: PHI @ CHN 2019-05-21: PHI @ CHN 2019-05-22: PHI @ CHN 2019-05-23: PHI @ CHN 2019-05-24: CIN @ CHN 2019-05-25: CIN @ CHN 2019-05-26: CIN @ CHN 2019-06-03: ANA @ CHN 2019-06-04: COL @ CHN ***K_STREAK_LENGTH 5 BY hendk001 PITCHING FOR CHN *** 2019-06-05: COL @ CHN 2019-06-06: COL @ CHN 2019-06-07: SLN @ CHN 2019-06-08: SLN @ CHN 2019-06-09: SLN @ CHN 2019-06-18: CHA @ CHN 2019-06-19: CHA @ CHN 2019-06-20: NYN @ CHN 2019-06-21: NYN @ CHN 2019-06-22: NYN @ CHN 2019-06-23: NYN @ CHN 2019-06-24: ATL @ CHN 2019-06-25: ATL @ CHN 2019-06-26: ATL @ CHN 2019-06-27: ATL @ CHN 2019-07-12: PIT @ CHN 2019-07-13: PIT @ CHN 2019-07-14: PIT @ CHN 2019-07-15: CIN @ CHN 2019-07-16: CIN @ CHN 2019-07-17: CIN @ CHN 2019-07-19: SDN @ CHN 2019-07-20: SDN @ CHN 2019-07-21: SDN @ CHN 2019-08-02: MIL @ CHN 2019-08-03: MIL @ CHN 2019-08-04: MIL @ CHN 2019-08-05: OAK @ CHN 2019-08-06: OAK @ CHN ***K_STREAK_LENGTH 5 BY unded001 PITCHING FOR CHN *** ***K_STREAK_LENGTH 6 BY unded001 PITCHING FOR CHN *** 2019-08-07: OAK @ CHN 2019-08-20: SFN @ CHN 2019-08-21: SFN @ CHN 2019-08-22: SFN @ CHN 2019-08-23: WAS @ CHN 2019-08-24: WAS @ CHN 2019-08-25: WAS @ CHN 2019-08-30: MIL @ CHN 2019-08-31: MIL @ CHN 2019-09-01: MIL @ CHN 2019-09-02: SEA @ CHN 2019-09-03: SEA @ CHN 2019-09-13: PIT @ CHN 2019-09-14: PIT @ CHN 2019-09-15: PIT @ CHN 2019-09-16: CIN @ CHN 2019-09-17: CIN @ CHN ***K_STREAK_LENGTH 5 BY darvy001 PITCHING FOR CHN *** ***K_STREAK_LENGTH 6 BY darvy001 PITCHING FOR CHN *** ***K_STREAK_LENGTH 7 BY darvy001 PITCHING FOR CHN *** ***K_STREAK_LENGTH 8 BY darvy001 PITCHING FOR CHN *** 2019-09-18: CIN @ CHN 2019-09-19: SLN @ CHN 2019-09-20: SLN @ CHN 2019-09-21: SLN @ CHN 2019-09-22: SLN @ CHN .

Let&#39;s overlay the two for a bit more clarity: . ax = sp_data_fg.plot(y=&#39;E_K5&#39;, legend=None, color=&#39;tab:blue&#39;, label=&#39;Theoretical K5&#39;); ax.plot(final_counts, &#39;X&#39;, color=&#39;tab:purple&#39;, label=&#39;Empirical K5&#39;); ax.set_title(&#39;MLB K Streaks: Expected vs Actual&#39;); ax.legend(); . . &lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd&quot;&gt; 2021-01-29T21:00:58.760807 image/svg+xml Matplotlib v3.3.2, https://matplotlib.org/ The rough hypothesis discussed in the previous section was that the static inputs to our model don&#39;t account for variation among the pitching population, and that would likely result in an occurence rate higher than predicted. . Just for fun, let&#39;s toy with the &#39;K rate&#39; a bit, and see how much better the fit is: . proj_df = sp_data_fg.copy() mult = 1.2 proj_df[&#39;K_rt_proj&#39;] = proj_df.K_rt_SP * mult proj_df[&#39;E_K5_proj&#39;] = proj_df.GS*(proj_df.BF_per_start_est-4)*proj_df.K_rt_proj**5 ax = proj_df.plot(y=&#39;E_K5_proj&#39;, linestyle=&#39;--&#39;, legend=None, color=&#39;tab:orange&#39;, label=&#39;Theoretical K5 (Adj)&#39;); ax.plot(final_counts, &#39;X&#39;, color=&#39;tab:purple&#39;, label=&#39;Empirical K5&#39;); ax.set_title(&#39;MLB K Streaks: Expected vs Actual&#39;); ax.legend(); . . &lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd&quot;&gt; 2021-01-30T13:07:01.368044 image/svg+xml Matplotlib v3.3.2, https://matplotlib.org/ Looks like giving the &#39;K rate&#39; a 20% boost results in a nearly perfect fit. If we extrapolate this slightly, we can see that if current trends hold, the frequency of K streaks will double again in the next five years: . extension = pd.Series(proj_df.E_K5_proj, index=range(1920, 2026)) extension[2025] = 225 extension.interpolate(method=&#39;quadratic&#39;, limit=25, inplace=True) extension ax = extension.plot(linestyle=&#39;--&#39;, legend=None, color=&#39;tab:orange&#39;, label=&#39;Projected K5&#39;); ax.plot(final_counts, &#39;X&#39;, color=&#39;tab:purple&#39;, label=&#39;Empirical K5&#39;); ax.set_title(&#39;MLB K Streaks: Expected vs Actual&#39;); ax.legend(); . . &lt;!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd&quot;&gt; 2021-01-29T21:38:27.661855 image/svg+xml Matplotlib v3.3.2, https://matplotlib.org/",

            "title": "The Case Against Risk Aversion in Effective Altruism",
            "content": "I don&#39;t have anything especially enlightening or quantitative to say here, so I&#39;ll just start with my unorganized thoughts and maybe add on later if I come up with a better case: . I have by no means read everything out there, but what I have seen on this topic has loosely taken on the following forms: . &quot;GiveWell is great not only because they do the work for you, and their analysis is trustworthy, but also because they are so rigorous that there&#39;s almost no chance of your money being wasted. You can rest easy knowing with reasonable certainty the ballpark impact that your money had on the world.&quot; . | &quot;You can think about giving the way you think about investing. Diversification is important. The balance of sure things like Against Malaria and riskier interventions such as Deworm the World in your &#39;giving portfolio&#39; should reflect your personal risk tolerance as a donor.&quot; . | As someone with a quantitative finance background, I would normally expect to be all-in on this line of thinking. However, while I have nothing against this perspective, I can&#39;t help but feel that it misses some important points. . Risk tolerance is a hugely important topic in finance &mdash; almost everything can be thought of in terms of expected value and variance, and the tradeoff between the two is often the primary factor in decision making. Furthermore, it is completely rational for two people to make completely different decisions, and hold completely different investment portfolios, purely on the basis of their respective risk tolerances &mdash; stocks are generally optimal for a young person, as they have superior expected value, and still present almost no risk of losing money in the long run; conversely, someone who is very close to retirement may justifiably have almost zero tolerance for short-term drawdown, and yet can do much better than money under the mattress, even with a very safe investment like bonds. . The key difference with charitable giving is that the stakeholder relationship is completely inverted &mdash; we are meant to optimize for the collective well-being of every creature on earth, rather than exactly one human &mdash; that&#39;s kind of the whole point! Investing is (sort of) a zero-sum game, and yet it matters a great deal if I lose my shirt in a trade against you &mdash; not because I am better or more worthy than you are, but because I simply won&#39;t be able to pay my bills (and it&#39;s not as if you&#39;re going to turn around and pay them on my behalf). Conversely, if I were hypothetically able to allocate my marginal dollars towards some intervention that had objectively the highest expected value for global welfare, I should absolutely do that (at least I think so). Even if it turns out that this intervention helped no one, assuming we still have reason to believe the EV was there, I truly don&#39;t think I should feel any worse about it. . An individual investor only gets so many rolls of the dice, and personal bankruptcy is a real thing with real consequences. When it comes to global welfare, it helps that we&#39;re all stakeholders. We collectively roll all of our dice against the same stack of chips, and our global bankroll cannot go to zero. Whether the best realized outcomes were funded by your dollars or mine, we truly should not care or count, from a rational perspective. I realize of course that most of the global bankroll is spent on, let&#39;s say not quite Effective Altruist causes, and one could argue that if everyone took so much risk it actually could be suboptimal, but I do think the point holds. For one thing, there can only be so many projects that are high-risk, high-reward, crucially under-funded, and lacking a track-record, for so long; the majority of funding gaps will always be relatively established. Finally, as I mentioned at the outset, even the EA community is mostly not behind this line of thinking, so I think we can comfortably rule out the risk tolerance of the global donation pool being too low for the foreseeable future. .",

            "title": "ghtop redux",
            "content": ". Introduction . We recently refactored the CLI tool ghtop, created by the CEO of GitHub, Nat Friedman. Nat even described our refactor as a “tour de force”. This post describes what we learned along the way. . Motivation . Recently, we released ghapi, a new python client for the GitHub API. ghapi provides unparalleled ease of access to the GitHub api, as well as utilities for interacting with GitHub Actions. Part of our motivation for creating ghapi was to accelerate the development of build, testing and deployment tools that help us in maintaining fastai projects. . We recently started using GitHub Actions to perform a wide variety of tasks automatically like: unit and integration tests, deploying documentation, building Docker containers and Conda packages, sharing releases on Twitter, and much more. This automation is key to maintaining the vast open source fastai ecosystem with very few maintainers. . Since ghapi is central to so many of these tasks, we wanted to stress-test its efficacy against other projects. That’s when we found ghtop. This tool allows you to stream all the public events happening on GitHub to a CLI dashboard. We thought it would be a fun learning experience to refactor this code base with various fastai tools such as ghapi and fastcore, but also try out new libraries like rich. . Features we added to our tools . While exploring ghtop, we added several features to various fastai tools that we found to be generally useful. . ghapi Authentication . We added the function github_auth_device which allows users to authenticate their api client with GitHub interactively in a browser. When we call this function we get the following prompt: . github_auth_device() . First copy your one-time code: 276E-C910 Then visit https://github.com/login/device in your browser, and paste the code when prompted. Shall we try to open the link for you? [y/n] . The browser opens a window that looks like this: . . The function then returns an authenticated token which you can use for various tasks. While this is not the only way to create a token, this is a user friendly way to create a token, especially for those who are not as familiar with GitHub. . ghapi Events . As a result of our explorations with ghtop, we added an event module to ghapi. This is useful for retrieving and inspecting sample events. Inspecting sample events is important as it allows you to prototype GitHub Actions workflows locally. You can sample real events with load_sample_events: . from ghapi.event import load_sample_events evts = load_sample_events() . Individual events are formatted as markdown lists to be human readable in Jupyter: . print(evts[0]) . - id: 14517925737 - type: PushEvent - actor: - id: 17030246 - login: BeckhamL - display_login: BeckhamL - gravatar_id: - url: https://api.github.com/users/BeckhamL - avatar_url: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17030246? - repo: - id: 154349747 - name: BeckhamL/leetcode - url: https://api.github.com/repos/BeckhamL/leetcode - payload: - push_id: 6194986903 - size: 1 - distinct_size: 1 - ref: refs/heads/master - head: 2055b0fcf22f1c3543e38b60199f6882266d32a5 - before: cb16921949c969b5153a0c23ce8fe516d2c8d773 - commits: - - sha: 2055b0fcf22f1c3543e38b60199f6882266d32a5 - author: - email: beckham.lam@mail.mcgill.ca - name: Beckham Lam - message: Create detectCapital.ts - distinct: True - url: https://api.github.com/repos/BeckhamL/leetcode/commits/2055b0fcf22f1c3543e38b60199f6882266d32a5 - public: True - created_at: 2020-12-13T21:32:34Z . You can also inspect the json data in an event, which are accessible as attributes: . evts[0].type . &#39;PushEvent&#39; . For example, here is the frequency of all full_types in the sample: . x,y = zip(*Counter([o.full_type for o in evts]).most_common()) plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6)) plt.barh(x[::-1],y[::-1]); . We can fetch public events in parallel with GhApi.list_events_parallel. In our experiments, repeatedly calling list_events_parallel is fast enough to fetch all current public activity from all users across the entire GitHub platform. We use this for ghtop. Behind the scenes, list_events_parallel uses Python&#39;s ThreadPoolExecutor to fetch events in parallel - no fancy distributed systems or complicated infrastructure necessary, even at the scale of GitHub! . %time api = GhApi() evts = api.list_events_parallel() len(evts) . CPU times: user 2 µs, sys: 0 ns, total: 2 µs Wall time: 4.29 µs . 240 . Note that the GitHub API is stateless, so successive calls to the API will likely return events already seen. We handle this by using a set operations to filter out events already seen. . ghapi pagination . One of the most cumbersome aspects of fetching lots of data from the GitHub api can be pagination. As mentioned in the documentation, different endpoints have different pagination rules and defaults. Therefore, many api clients offer clunky or incomplete interfaces for pagination. . In ghapi we added an entire module with various tools to make paging easier. Below is an example for retrieving repos for the github org. Without pagination, we can only retrieve a fixed number at a time (by default 30): . api = GhApi() repos = api.repos.list_for_org(&#39;fastai&#39;) len(repos) . 30 . However, to get more we can paginate through paged: . from ghapi.event import paged repos = paged(api.repos.list_for_org, &#39;fastai&#39;) for page in repos: print(len(page), page[0].name) . 30 fast-image 30 fastforest 30 .github 8 tweetrel . You can learn more about this functionality by reading the docs. . fastcore Sparklines . Part of goals for refactoring ghtop were to introduce cool visualizations in the terminal of data. We drew inspiration from projects like bashtop, which have CLI interfaces that look like this: . Concretely, we really liked the idea of sparklines in the terminal. Therefore, we created the ability to show sparklines with fastcore: . from fastcore.utils import sparkline data = [9,6,None,1,4,0,8,15,10] print(f&#39;without &quot;empty_zero&quot;: {sparkline(data, empty_zero=False)}&#39;) print(f&#39; with &quot;empty_zero&quot;: {sparkline(data, empty_zero=True )}&#39;) . without &#34;empty_zero&#34;: ▅▂ ▁▂▁▃▇▅ with &#34;empty_zero&#34;: ▅▂ ▁▂ ▃▇▅ . For more information on this function, read the docs. Later in this post, we will describe how we used Rich to add color and animation to these sparklines. . fastcore EventTimer . Because we wanted streaming event data to automatically populate sparklines, we created EventTimer that constructs a histogram according to a frequency and time span you set. With EventTimer, you can add events with add, and get the number of events and their frequency: . from fastcore.utils import EventTimer from time import sleep import random def _randwait(): yield from (sleep(random.random()/200) for _ in range(100)) c = EventTimer(store=5, span=0.03) for o in _randwait(): c.add(1) print(f&#39;Num Events: {c.events}, Freq/sec: {c.freq:.01f}&#39;) print(&#39;Most recent: &#39;, sparkline(c.hist), *L(c.hist).map(&#39;{:.01f}&#39;)) . Num Events: 6, Freq/sec: 301.1 Most recent: ▃▁▁▇▁ 323.6 274.8 291.3 390.9 283.6 . For more information, see the docs. . CLI Animations With Rich . Rich is an amazing python library that allows you to create beautiful, animated and interactive CLI interfaces. Below is a preview of some its features: . Rich also offers animated elements like spinners: . ... and progress bars: . While this post is not about rich, we highly recommend visiting the repo and the docs to learn more. Rich allows you to create your own custom elements. We created two custom elements - Stats and FixedPanel, which we describe below: . Stats: Sparklines with metrics . Stats renders a group of sparklines along with a spinner and a progress bar. First we define our sparklines, the last argument being a list of event types to count: . from ghtop.richext import * from ghtop.all_rich import * console = Console() s1 = ESpark(&#39;Issues&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, [IssueCommentEvent, IssuesEvent]) s2 = ESpark(&#39;PR&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, [PullRequestEvent, PullRequestReviewCommentEvent, PullRequestReviewEvent]) s3 = ESpark(&#39;Follow&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, [WatchEvent, StarEvent]) s4 = ESpark(&#39;Other&#39;, &#39;red&#39;) s = Stats([s1,s2,s3,s4], store=5, span=.1, stacked=True) console.print(s) . 🌍 Issues PR Follow Other Quota /min 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 ━━━━━━━ 0% .
