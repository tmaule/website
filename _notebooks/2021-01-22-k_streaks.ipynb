    "On 09/17/2019, Yu Darvish recorded eight consecutive strikeouts for the Chicago Cubs. The game announcers hailed this as an incredible streak, and noted that the all-time MLB record is ten consecutive strikeouts by Tom Seaver in 1970. Given that one of the most significant changes in baseball over the past several decades is the increase in strikeout rate, I was curious to find out how much more likely such an occurrence is today versus, say, 50 years ago. In the end, I find that occurence of K streaks is growing exponentially, and Seaver's feat was roughly 1,164 times less likely than Darvish's."
